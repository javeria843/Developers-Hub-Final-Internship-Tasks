üè† Task 3: Multimodal ML ‚Äì Housing Price Prediction
Objective Predict house prices using both tabular features and house images.

Dataset

Tabular: Housing Sales CSV

Images: House photos (JPEG/PNG)

Steps

CNN: Extract image features using pretrained model (e.g., ResNet)

Tabular: Normalize and encode structured data

Fusion: Concatenate image + tabular features

Model: Train regression model (e.g., XGBoost or MLP)

Evaluation: MAE, RMSE

How to Run

bash
python multimodal_housing.py
Output

Final model predictions

MAE and RMSE scores

Feature fusion pipeline

Skills Gained

ü§ñ Task 4: Context-Aware Chatbot with LangChain or RAG
Objective Build a chatbot that remembers conversation history and retrieves answers from external documents.

Dataset Custom corpus (Wikipedia, PDFs, internal docs)

Steps

Embedding: Convert documents to vectors using sentence-transformers

Vector Store: Store in FAISS or Chroma

Retrieval: Use LangChain or RAG to fetch relevant chunks

Memory: Enable chat history tracking

Deployment: Build UI with Streamlit

How to Run

bash
streamlit run chatbot_app.py
Output

Chatbot with memory + retrieval

Streamlit interface

Real-time responses from corpus

Skills Gained

LangChain / RAG integration

Semantic search via embeddings

Conversational memory

LLM deployment with Streamlit


Model export for production
